# Platform Container Examples

This repository contains examples of deploying the [Particular Service Platform](https://docs.particular.net/platform/) tools (notably [ServiceControl](https://docs.particular.net/servicecontrol/) and [ServicePulse](https://docs.particular.net/servicepulse/)) using containers. These examples can be used as starting points for deployment scripts, or as a tool to learn how the different pieces work together, but should not be used as-is in production environments.

## Examples

- [Deploying to Azure Container Apps using Bicep](/azure-container-apps/)
- [Running locally with Docker Compose](/docker-compose/)
- [Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster using helm](/helm/)
- [Deploying to Unraid OS](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=servicecontrol#r)
