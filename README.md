# Platform Container Examples

This repository contains examples of deploying the [Particular Service Platform](https://docs.particular.net/platform/) tools (notably [ServiceControl](https://docs.particular.net/servicecontrol/) and [ServicePulse](https://docs.particular.net/servicepulse/)) using containers. These examples can be used as starting points for deployment scripts, or as a tool to learn how the different pieces work together, but should not be used as-is in production environments.

> [!NOTE]
>  [Examples are not production ready](https://docs.particular.net/samples/#samples-are-not-production-ready)
